# Overview
There is concern if there is any review bias based on a customers participation in the Amazon Vine program. I chose to look at the Musical Instrument category to determine if a customer was more likely to give a 5 star review if they were a participant in the Vine program.


# Results
Based on the reviews in the Musical Instruments the Vine and unpaid reviews appear to have the same percentage of 5 star reviews. 

## Total Reviews
- Vine Reviews: 60
- Unpaid Reviewes: 14,477

## 5 Star Reviews
- Vine 5 Star Reviews: 34
- Unpaid Reviews: 8,212

## Percentage of 5 Star Reviews
- Percentage of 5 Star Vine Reviews: 56.6%
- Percentage of 5 Star Unpaid Reviews: 56.7%

# Analysis
Based on the Musical Instrument category, there does not appear to be any significant bias when at just 5 star reviews. The percentage of 5 star reviews for Vine participants was 56.6% while those who did not participate is 56.7%.  This analysis just looked at 5 star reviews, but it would be good to look at the spread of all the reviews to get a full picture of the reviews.
